1. getText() works only if inner text is there else need to use getAttribute("NAME OF THE ATTRIBUTE")
2. Actions (class) → Used to create a chain of multiple actions. (to Perform mouse action)
3. Action (interface) → Represents the final built action that can be executed. (to Build)(to store created action)
4. .build().perform() and .perform() -> will do same thing.
5. dragAndDrop != dragAndDropBy
